// Synchronization in Java is used to control access to shared resources by multiple threads to prevent data inconsistency. 
// You can achieve synchronization using the synchronized keyword or by using synchronized blocks.
// Steps:
//    1. Choose the synchronization object: Decide which object to use for synchronization.
//    2.Ensure consistency and safety: Make sure that all accesses to the shared resource are properly synchronized.
//    3. Test thoroughly: Test your synchronized code with multiple threads to ensure that it behaves correctly under concurrent execution.
//    4. Optimize performance: Consider the performance implications of synchronization and optimize your code if necessary.
